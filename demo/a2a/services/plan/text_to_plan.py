    Uses Gemini to generate a structured plan from user text.

        user_text: The natural language request from the user.

    Returns:
        A dictionary structured as the plan, or an empty plan on failure.

    # A clear, structured prompt for the model to follow.
    prompt = f"""
    Analyze the user's request and generate a JSON object that breaks down the request into a list of services.

    **Instructions:**
    1. The output must be a valid JSON object.
    2. The root of the object must be a key named "services".
    3. The "services" key must contain an array of objects.
    4. Each object in the array must have two keys: "service" (a short, one-word identifier) and "description" (a summary of that part of the request).

    **Example Input:**
    "I want ohlcv data for BTC and ETH and also get me the latest news on DOGE from reddit or x. Get me the weather prediction for tomorrow in London."

    **Example Output:**
    {{
      "services": [
        {{ "service": "ohlcv", "description": "get ohlcv data for BTC and ETH" }},
        {{ "service": "news",  "description": "get the latest news on DOGE from reddit or x" }},
